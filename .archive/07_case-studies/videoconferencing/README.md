# Video Conferencing System Design

This module provides a comprehensive deep-dive into the system design of a scalable, real-time Video Conferencing application (similar to Zoom, Teams, or Google Meet).

It covers the entire architectural journey from high-level requirements to low-level data models, signaling protocols, and AI integration.

## 📚 Module Structure

The content is organized into two main phases:

### Phase 1: System Design Overview

Foundational concepts, requirements, and high-level architecture.

* [01_System-Design-Overview-Part1-A.md](./01_System-Design-Overview-Part1-A.md): Requirements Analysis & Capacity Estimation
* [01_System-Design-Overview-Part1-B.md](./01_System-Design-Overview-Part1-B.md): High-Level Architecture & Data Layer
* [01_System-Design-Overview-Part1-C.md](./01_System-Design-Overview-Part1-C.md): Concurrency, Signaling & WebRTC Fundamentals
* [01_System-Design-Overview-Part1-D.md](./01_System-Design-Overview-Part1-D.md): Deep Dive: Transport Protocols (TCP/UDP/RTP)

### Phase 2: Detailed Design & Architecture

In-depth design of specific components, APIs, and advanced workflows.

* [02_Detailed-Design-Part1-A.md](./02_Detailed-Design-Part1-A.md): API Design (REST & gRPC)
* [02_Detailed-Design-Part1-B.md](./02_Detailed-Design-Part1-B.md): Sequence Diagrams & Interaction Flows
* [02_Detailed-Design-Part1-C.md](./02_Detailed-Design-Part1-C.md): Scalability Patterns (Mesh vs. SFU vs. MCU)
* [02_Detailed-Design-Part1-D.md](./02_Detailed-Design-Part1-D.md): Operational Excellence (Observability & SLOs)
* [02_Detailed-Design-Part1-E.md](./02_Detailed-Design-Part1-E.md): Security Architecture (Zero Trust & E2EE)
* [02_Detailed-Design-Part1-F-A.md](./02_Detailed-Design-Part1-F-A.md): Data Models (SQL/Redis) - Core Models
* [02_Detailed-Design-Part1-F-B.md](./02_Detailed-Design-Part1-F-B.md): Data Models (SQL/Redis) & Signaling Contracts - API & Schema
* [02_Detailed-Design-Part1-G.md](./02_Detailed-Design-Part1-G.md): Advanced Workflows (Dynamic Switching, Recording, AI)
* [02_Detailed-Design-Part1-H.md](./02_Detailed-Design-Part1-H.md): Infrastructure, Scalability & Analytics

## ⚠️ Note on Code Implementation

This repository focuses exclusively on **System Design Documentation** (High-Level Design and Low-Level Design specs).

Actual code implementations (e.g., Python/FastAPI services, C#/.NET backends, Node.js signaling servers) are maintained in a dedicated repository:
